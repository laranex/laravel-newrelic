# Laravel Newrelic

Laravel Newrelic is a package that provides custom log channel for Newrelic, also provides the listeners to split the octane transaction into each job and event transactions.

## Why do'd use the Newrelic Monolog Enricher?
[Newrelic Monolog Enricher](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-monolog-logenricher-php) is not compatible with the Monolog 3.0 and They are not updating the package. So, I have created this package to provide the custom log channel for Newrelic.
